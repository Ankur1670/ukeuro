&raquo;	Accreditation standards are generally considered optimal and attainable.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Accreditation gives an organization a visible commitment to improve the quality of its products and / or services, ensure a safe environment, and is constantly working to reduce risk.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Independent evaluations contribute to the success of the organization.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Accreditation has gained world attention as an effective tool for quality assessment and management.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Trust in the market and our public services are essential. Trust is placed in products and services, often without prior reflection of the customer, such as the rules and standards by which products are manufactured and services are provided.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	The use of a recognized route has the advantage of a single transparent and reproducible approach. Over time, this should improve stability, leading to better risk management. At the same time, it should eliminate the cost of reinstalling the wheel, thus contributing to the discovery of an open and modern government.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Accreditation provides an alternative means of ensuring the credibility of public activities or activities affecting national prestige.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Companies receive independent evaluations either by choice (for example, to reduce the risk of product failure) or as a result of legal requirements (such as health and safety regulations).<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Most often, these assessments are instrument calibration, product testing, equipment inspection and quality management system certification.
