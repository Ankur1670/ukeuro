&raquo;	Initial reply<br/>

&raquo;	Presentation of application form with administration fee. Note: Applicants must follow the requirements of applicable standards (eg ISO 17021).

&raquo;	We will review and comment. If necessary, we will ask you to revise and provide feedback before the next step.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	Propose impartiality from 'respective bodies' at the independence of your organization and become a legal entity.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	For the first six evaluations, you should first notify EUULS of your intention to conduct the assessment.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	You send us photocopies / e-mails of all documents related to these evaluation and certification missions, 
demonstrating compliance with the documents we reviewed earlier.<br/><br/>

&raquo;	We will issue a draft certificate of recognition. Your validation context will be defined at this time. 
This will be subject to the site cookie satisfying your activity.<br/><br/>

&raquo;	EAULS participates in your next assessment and certification activity.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	You do four more evaluations and send us copies of the documents.<br/><br/>
&raquo;	We are looking at the next convenient evaluation.<br/><br/>

<strong>During the previous actions, we would have expected many meetings to be held for meetings and visits to your operating premises.</strong><br/>
&raquo;	Issue of certificate, if applicable.<br/>
&raquo;	You continue to evaluate and certify but you do not need to send paperwork.<br/>
&raquo;	We will monitor your level of activity and conduct the accreditation test accordingly.<br/>
&raquo;	Please inform us about all certification activities.<br/>
&raquo;	On monitoring and recognition, including assignment of recognition numbers.
