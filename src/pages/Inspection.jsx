Defects due to (damage caused by use).

<p>The most common methods are visual digitization, industrial digitization, microscopy, penetration inspection, magnetic particle inspection, X-ray or radiographic testing, ultrasonic testing. Foucault, acoustic emission testing and thermographic inspection. In addition, many non-destructive inspections can be performed with a precise scale or, when in motion, a balance of control. Stereoscopic microscopes are often used to examine small products such as printed circuit boards.
