<strong>Product certification </strong><br/>

Product certification is a means of demonstrating that a product, process, or service meets specified requirements.<br/><br/>


Product certification or product qualification is the process of certification that a given product has passed performance tests and quality assurance tests, and meets the eligibility criteria set out in contracts, rules or regulations. Specifications (commonly referred to as the "Certification Scheme" in the product certification area).<br/><br/>
Most product certification bodies (or product certifications) are accredited in accordance with ISO / IEC Guide 65: 1996, an international standard to ensure the competence of organizations certifying products.<br/><br/>
Certification schemes are typically written to include both performance testing methods that must also be tested for the product, as well as the criteria that must be met to certify the product.<br/><br/>


Certificates (and certificates attesting their existence) are often called "certificates" in everyday jargon of various industries.<br/><br/>


A product can be verified to meet a specification or stamped with a specification number. This in itself does not indicate that the article is fit for a particular purpose. Individuals or groups of certification systems (engineers, unions, code writers, government, industry, etc. build) have the responsibility to consider the choice of specialties available, select the appropriate ones, define the qualification limits, and these Enforce limits. The end users of the product are responsible for the correct use of the item. Products must be used according to their list for certification to be effective.<br/><br/>


Product certification is often required in sensitive areas of industry and markets where failure can have serious consequences, such as a negative impact on the health and well-being of individuals or individuals using this product.<br/><br/>
For example, certification in aerospace applications is strict because lower weight requirements cause higher stresses on components, requiring proper metal and manufacturing accuracy. Other examples of sensitive products include food products, pharmaceuticals, health products, hazardous products, and products that emit radio frequencies such as computers and cell phones.<br/><br/>

<strong>Personal Certification</strong><br/>
The Conformity Assessment Body (CABs), recognized by the people of the European Union, has achieved and demonstrated its ability to remain at the forefront of excellence in training and review.<br/><br/>


The European Union encourages conformity assessment bodies to remain innovative in their approach and to ensure that knowledge is transferred and skills are examined and developed.<br/><br/>
